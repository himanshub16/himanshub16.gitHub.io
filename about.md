Hi!

I'm an engineer who loves writing [software](https://github.com/himanshub16) to make the world a better place.
I have 1 year+ of work experience working as a software intern and contractor at [Sumo Logic](https://sumologic.com) and [Atlan](https://atlan.com).

Graduating in summer of 2020, I'm actively looking for full-time roles.

My interests include distributed systems, cloud computing, operating systems, and data-pipelines.

You can find my resume [here](/resume) or contact me via one of the ways below.
